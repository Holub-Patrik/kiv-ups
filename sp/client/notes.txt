So... I can't really detect if the server closed connection
Thus I have to add some kind of passive attempt to get a response.
If no response is coming for a long time, I have to assume the server is dead and disconnect the connection

add a proper sliding window message handling
currently InTCPtor breaks the reading, since it sends the header, and a bit of the message, but not the whole message

Restructure this shit
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I need to have a drawThread and GameThread, each having access to some joint datastructures
