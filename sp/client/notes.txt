So... I can't really detect if the server closed connection
Thus I have to add some kind of passive attempt to get a response.
If no response is coming for a long time, I have to assume the server is dead and disconnect the connection

add a proper sliding window message handling
currently InTCPtor breaks the reading, since it sends the header, and a bit of the message, but not the whole message

Restructure this shit
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I need to have a drawThread and GameThread, each having access to some joint datastructures

Create this
interface RGComponent() {
  Draw() // has to tak no arguments
  Init(width int, height int)
  ReCalculate(width int, height int)
  Register(RGComponent component, id int)
  Unregister(RGComponent component, id int)
}

The Register function allows to create inherited objects, which will be recalculated the parent Values
If this works, it will be amazing
This still however leaves the question of how to deal with clicabled in a better way. Aka how to pass in/out needed data from global context
