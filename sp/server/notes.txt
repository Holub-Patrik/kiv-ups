When connecting normally, the game is starting and thus there isn't info to send
The only meaningful messages are messages to send other player info
Upon game start the clients themselves will draw 2 hidden cards.
When reconnecting, additional information has to be sent?

PlayerID would be the server index, but I don't know if that really is achievable
Yea, fuck it PKRPPTRN[PlayerNick]

Connecting:
bet has to be zero, no cards so no player state
[PlayerCount]([PlayerNick][Chips]..)

Reconnecting:
[Chips][Folded(Either 1 for True or 0 for false)][PlayerCount]([PlayerNick][Chips][ActionTaken][ActionAmount]..)

Game Showdown:
[PlayerCount]([PlayerNick][Card1][Card2]..)

ActionTaken:
Small Int:
0 = Check
1 = Call
2 = Fold
3 = Bet
4 = Left/Disconnected
