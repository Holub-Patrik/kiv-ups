PN | (Raise? Pass? Skip?)
Raise = Msg From Client
Skip = Connection issues / Disconnect Msg
Pass = Msg From Client / Result from Skip
Fold = Msg From Client / Result from Skip

(Pass Round)
In case skip is executed
- If connection issues are cause -> Execute pass
- If disconnect is the cause -> Execute fold

(Betting Round)
In case skip is executed -> Execute fold

P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> P4

Within a round
- If a bet is placed, that round is now Betting round
- Betting round forces additional check at the end if everyone has placed a bet

Maybe I just use a map
unordered_map<string, function>
function(const string& payload) -> std::variant<all options>
Since I have the entire payload, I can use very easy substring operations to convert messsages to data

FIX
\n is sent as a last character
Needs to be trimmed off
